spamsum is a fuzzy hash specifically designed for hashing email messages
to detect if they are SPAM. The spamsum utility includes the ability to
generate the spamsum hash and check a new message against a existing set
of hashes to find a match.

pyspamsum is a Python wrapper for the core API of spamsum.

    >>> spamsum.edit_distance(s1, s2)
    27

    # Evaluate the spamsum of some strings
    >>> sum1 = spamsum.spamsum(s1)
    >>> sum2 = spamsum.spamsum(s2)
    >>> sum3 = spamsum.spamsum(s3)
    >>> print(sum1)

    # Compare two spamsums. 0 = no match, 100 = perfect match.
    >>> spamsum.match(sum1, sum1)
    100
    >>> spamsum.match(sum1, sum2)
    72
    >>> spamsum.match(sum1, sum3)
    0
